# React Sample App

This sample app provides a minimal setup to get the SDK working with React in Vite.

We provide React components for player + UI, so you can easily integrate the SDK into your React app, just like how you use a 3rd party React component.

## How to Run this Sample App

- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the `react` directory
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Start the development server: `yarn dev`
- Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

# Player basic analysis

## Overview

This sample project showcases how to send player logs to the player's default [analysis service]() by setting the AnalyticsConfig when creating the player.
You must obtain the analytics license token first in order to transmit player playback events to our data platform.

# Playerback API Sample App - basic analysis

This pure sample app demonstrates how to integrate with BlendVision One Playback API, get playback info and play with the player provided by the player SDK.

- Analytics Field Definition

  - `analytics.token`: The field is required, this appears to be a token or authentication key for analytics purposes.

  - `analytics.sessionId`: The field is optional, this represents a session identifier, likely used to track user sessions or interactions with the application.

  - `analytics.resourceId`: The field is optional, this could be an identifier for a specific resource or source within your application, used for tracking or categorization.

  - `analytics.resourceType`: The field is optional, this might indicate the type or category of the resource mentioned above.

  - `analytics.<customProperty>`: The field is optional, this is a placeholder for custom data that you can include in your analytics events, allowing you to send additional information as needed, for example `analytics.my_log_prop` will add `property my_log_prop`.

**DRM integration**

DRM integration is also included in this sample app, this part is required if you want to use DRM protected stream.

Caution: License requests accepts `x-custom-data` header instead.
